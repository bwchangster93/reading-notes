1. What is a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), and why is it important for an organization?

A SOP is a company policy on the what, when, why, and how tasks are to be conducted throughout a company. This is important because it
informs employees how to conduct their work for the company as a whole.

2. What are the three types of documents that should be included in an SOP manual? Briefly describe each type.

Policy - this answers the broad overarching guidance (why?).
SOP - this is what needs to be done, when it needs to be done, and why it's being done.
Work instructions (WI)- these are step by step instructions on how to perform a specific task.

3. Why are SOPs considered a primary way to implement or enforce policies in an organization?

SOPs are used to to steer an organization to achieve the mission, vision, and goals. SOPs make these actionable and also encourage consistency
in execution of tasks.

4. What does the author emphasize regarding the audience when writing SOPs, and why is it essential to consider them?

There is no specific way to write an SOP. SOPs, also, can become irrelevant over time so it is vital to update them frequently.

5. Imagine you are a part of a multicultural team responsible for following an SOP. 
How would you address potential misunderstandings or differing interpretations of the procedure due to cultural differences? 
Propose strategies to foster effective cross-cultural communication.

In this situation, I would reach out to team members and offer to help with any possible misunderstandings of the SOP. 
If there is an actual issue with the SOP itself, I would report it to management and ask for clarification.
