1. What are the main differences between anti-virus and anti-malware software?

An anti-virus is a program that is continually working in the background to watch for malware.
An anti-malware software is something you activate on demand to scan the system for malware.

2. What are some signs or symptoms that may indicate a malware infection on your PC?

The biggest signs could be when a system is suddenly operating at a slower-than-usual performance, a sudden burst of pop-ups,
and other anomalous issues.

3. Explain the difference between a full system scan and a quick scan when using antimalware software.

A full system scan will go through the entirety of all files, folders, and processes. Because this goes checks every possible
location, it is very time consuming. A quick scan will only check the most common places for malware to be present. This is more
useful for routine checks on a system for maintenance.

4. What should you do if your computer is infected with ransomware?

In the event of ransomware, it is unlikely you will be able to operate with normal function. This means it will be unlikely
you will be able to perform operations that will remove the malware. In this situation, it would be best to rely on a backup
of the system, and perform a system restore.

5. Compare and contrast malware removal techniques in Windows PCs with those in other operating systems like macOS or Linux. 
How might these different approaches reflect the cultural values and priorities of the technology

Windows PCs are highly susceptible to malware as there are many different malwares created for the OS. Newer versions of Windows
does seem to make it difficult to enter diagnostics modes, while Linux relies much more on the terminal. This could yield to making
Linux more friendly for malware diagnostics.
