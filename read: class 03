This reading distinguishes between hard and soft skills. It explains that not all skills required for employment opportunities are technical.

1 - Help desk professionals are the first line in support. These people are the first to contact clients/customers and work on either solving or narrowing down the problem at hand.
2 - In my previous field of employments, my most recent two were in the entertainment (casino) industry for 10 years, and then working as a real estate wholesaler for roughly 1 year. 
  Being a real estate wholesaler definitely required more soft skills than hard skills. This was because it was mostly dealing with people and and incorrect statement or conversation could cause the sale to be lost. 
The casino industry is much more balanced in terms of soft and hard skills. There were many technical skills that are required to properly run the games, but your customer relations and communication skills were vital to keeping customers content.
3 - Security skills have become so important recently because attacks have become so much more prevelant. 
Security skills allow for help desk technicians to recognize when attacks are present and also help them allign and understand company security policies better.
4- Writing skills are vital due to the fact that technicians need work work in teams. Issues need to be documented, and then later, common problems can be found.
Critical thinking skills must be present in order to solve issues at hand. Without these skills, problems would go unsolved.
