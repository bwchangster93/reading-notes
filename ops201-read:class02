Understanding Bash is extremely important in the field of cybersecurity as it is a main interface in which we will interact with computers. It can help automate many repeptitive tasks and make us much more efficient.

1 - A shell is essentially the main input in which we are able to communicate with the computer.
2 - Bash is able to search through the directories to see if a command exists.
3 - A system running bash will start the command lines with "$"
4 - Bash is extremely powerful due to how much time it saves. It is scriptable due to the fact that it can run hundreds of lines of code at once.
5 - In my experience working as a poker dealer, efficiency was key in order to maximize rates. Due to the main source of income coming from tips, the more hands I was able to complete, the more I made. Over time I developed advanced multi-tasking skills, task prioritization, all while maintaining the integrity of the game.
