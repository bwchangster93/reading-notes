Solar cells, also known as photovoltaic cells, convert sunlight (solar light) directly into electricity through a process called the photovoltaic effect. This effect involves the interaction of photons (particles of light) with certain materials, typically made from semiconductors like silicon. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how solar cells work:

Absorption of Photons: When sunlight (which is composed of photons) reaches the surface of a solar cell, the photons are absorbed by the semiconductor material, usually made of silicon. The energy from the photons is transferred to electrons in the atoms of the semiconductor material, causing them to become excited and move from their lower energy state to a higher energy state.

Generation of Electron-Hole Pairs: The absorbed energy causes some of the electrons to break free from their atoms, leaving behind "holes." These electron-hole pairs are often referred to as "excitons." The separation of charges, with electrons becoming mobile and free to move, is essential for generating an electric current.

Electric Field and Junctions: Within the solar cell, there are typically two different layers: the p-type layer (positively charged) and the n-type layer (negatively charged). These layers are created by intentionally introducing specific impurities into the semiconductor material. The junction between these layers creates an electric field.

Drift of Charge Carriers: Due to the electric field at the p-n junction, the free electrons and holes are separated and pushed in opposite directions. Electrons move toward the n-type layer, while holes move toward the p-type layer.

Creation of Voltage and Current: As the separated charge carriers (electrons and holes) move through the semiconductor material, they create an imbalance of electrons in the different layers. This imbalance results in the buildup of voltage between the two layers, creating an electric potential difference.

Collection of Charge Carriers: To harvest the generated electrical energy, metal contacts are placed on the top and bottom layers of the solar cell. These contacts provide pathways for the separated electrons and holes to flow out of the cell, creating an electric current. This current can then be used to power electrical devices or be stored in batteries.

Conversion to Usable Electricity: The flow of electrons through an external circuit from the n-type layer to the p-type layer generates an electric current, which can be utilized to power various applications, from small electronic devices to homes and industries.

In summary, solar cells work by absorbing sunlight and using the energy from photons to create mobile charge carriers (electrons and holes) within a semiconductor material. The separation and movement of these charge carriers create an electric current that can be harnessed as usable electricity.
