1. What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?

Three key factors that contribute that all members generally speak in the same proportions as eachother, the team has average social sensitivity, and minimal micromanagement.

2. Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.

In 2016, I had made a switch from one casino to another while having a brief period of overlap. During this time, it was night and day of how the teams were run. At my prior casino
named Hideaway Cardroom, there was daily micromanagement from the owner and constant ridicule/emotional outbursts from the shift manager. This caused an extremely hostile working
environment which eventually led to team morale damage. On the otherhand, the new casino I had joined allowed team members to conduct their work how team members found fit, provided
they provided results. This new casino ended up becoming the most successful poker room in the PNW in history.

3. What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?

Having a high degree of psychological safety provides comfort for team members, thus creating a healthy work environment. This, in turn, results in high productivity and efficiency.
